Prometheva is a medium-sized exoplanet located in a star system with a K0-type star. It is a planet with a considerable hydrosphere and an impressive biodiversity. On this planet lives a fairly advanced civilization of about 5 000 000 000 inhabitants. To give a better perspective of what life on Prometheus would be like, we should start with some general geographical aspects. There are a variety of commodities, mountain ranges rich in minerals and metals, abundant jungles and forests that provide food and timber, and multiple large, resource-dense freshwater bodies. They are affected by UV rays, therefore, humans adapt their food and immune system to live with such effects, moreover, the vision and color perception of life forms on such a planet could adapt to a more reddish environment, or they could develop other ways of perceiving their environment, such as infrared or ultrasonic vision.

																It is a planet that due to its climatic conditions the adaptations of species and humans would be minimal, such as the change of color of plants by pigments and slightly a change in the color of the skin of humans to orange tones by their.

															<h3><a href="#">Vegetation</a></h3>
															<p>
																Due to the starlight, the plants would take on an orange and yellowish color because of their pigments, such as carotenoids, to enhance energy utilization. They would also have a rich nutritional value.

															<h3><a href="#">Diet</a></h3>
															<p>
																The ideal diet for this planet would be vegan, based on plants and insects. Plants would have a rich content of vitamin A and D. Excessive vitamin A and D could lead to hypervitaminosis and humans would gradually adapt to this.

																They use a mixed zoning system with family apartments, retail and offices with dense vertical buildings, large green spaces and agricultural fields that allow accessibility to public transportation and necessary resources. Allowing civilization to enjoy good physical and mental health through urban greening.

															<h3><a href="#">Radiation</a></h3>
															<p>
																 The rate and intensity of photosynthesis might be lower, as K-type stars have a smaller luminosity (0.4LSun) than the Sun, and less radiation will reach the surface. However, the planet will be closer to the star than the Earth is to the Sun, so this reduction might not be that significant.

															<h3><a href="#">Colours</a></h3>
															<p>
																 Due to the star's light, not only would the vegetation have orange and yellow tones, 
																but also the oceans would be grayish and the surface would have reddish-brown and orange tones.
