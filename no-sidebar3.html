Prometheva is a medium-sized exoplanet located in a star system with a K0-type star. It is a planet with a considerable hydrosphere and an impressive biodiversity. On this planet lives a fairly advanced civilization of about 5 000 000 000 inhabitants. To give a better perspective of what life on Prometheus would be like, we should start with some general geographical aspects. There are a variety of commodities, mountain ranges rich in minerals and metals, abundant jungles and forests that provide food and timber, and multiple large, resource-dense freshwater bodies. They are affected by UV rays, therefore, humans adapt their food and immune system to live with such effects, moreover, the vision and color perception of life forms on such a planet could adapt to a more reddish environment, or they could develop other ways of perceiving their environment, such as infrared or ultrasonic vision.

												<h3>The people on Prometheva are also affected by some of the aspects caused by their star</h3>
												<p>
													   	The rate and intensity of photosynthesis might be lower, as K-type stars have a smaller luminosity (0.4LSun) 
													than the Sun, and less radiation will reach the surface. However, the planet will be closer to the star than the 
													Earth is to the Sun, so this reduction might not be that significant.
                                                                                                         	  With this perspective on how Prometheva is structured and looks, it’s easier to understand the civilization living 
													on it. As mentioned earlier, the human population on Prometheva is around 5 000 000 000, this large population is 
													sustained by a relatively small planet, thanks to various technological advancements and the abundance of resources on 
													the planet itself. In relation to how this civilization obtains the vast amount of energy it requires to sustain itself 
													and grow, they use a robust network of interconnected power sources, the primary of which is nuclear power. This power
													is harnessed with autonomous and subterranean nuclear power plants, these provide the bulk of the power consumed on 
													Prometheva. In addition to this, they heavily exploit the geothermal potential near the various volcanic mountain ranges
													on the planet, they incorporate biomass generators into their population centers, harness the power of large aquatic
													currents with hydroelectric generators deep in bodies of water, use offshore wind farms to exploit the stronger wind gusts,
													and also blend solar panels into most structures and vehicles. They then send this energy to the different areas of the 
													planet via sophisticated long range energy transfer satellite networks. 
                                                                                                          	 In terms of the way they’ve developed infrastructure on the planet, we can identify a few main characteristics, 
													first of all, their distribution. We can find most cities and population centers are located either along the coasts of the 
													Great Lakes and navigable river or near the mountain ranges, this is due to being able to access the water’s bountiful resources
													and trade opportunities, and also the materials offered by the mountains. Secondly, when developing they have emphasized 
													having a reduced impact on the environment and creating sustainable resource extraction cycles, be that through reforestation
													policies, biodiversity protection laws, protected wildlife reserves, planned urban and industrial development, etc. Third, they
													construct nearly 100% with 3D printing technology, allowing buildings to be constructed autonomously and quickly, and only needing
													human intervention in reduced cases, when more complex structural elements are needed to be created. Fourth, for inter-regional 
													transportation of either people of goods, they use mag-lev bullet trains, for intercontinental transportation, they use large shipping
													cruisers or flying vehicles. For intercity travel they combine a network of personal vehicles, with a very developed public 
													transportation system. These systems usually include trams, metro lines, bus rapid transit lines, etc. They also prioritize walkability 
													and the usage of vehicles like bicycles, with very widespread bike lanes and pedestrian paths. Fifth, to reduce the environmental 
													footprint of their agricultural sector , they use advanced biotechnology methods and vertical farming to improve their food production to
													area ratio. Sixth, they use intelligent water processing and distribution networks to reduce water wastage. Seventh, in terms of their 
													urban design, they use a mixed zoning system, prioritizing diversity of usages, such as family apartments, shops and offices all blended into
													dense vertical buildings, creating very diverse and lively districts and towns. They base their designs off a couple core principles, 
													ease of movement, basically being able to catch public transportation almost anywhere and to almost any destination in the city, 15 minute
													city design, being able to access all amenities and necessities in a 15 minute walking distance from your home, urban greening, or adding 
													trees and plants almost anywhere possible to improve mental health, aesthetics and air quality, parks and open space planning, which
													prioritizes creating many and easily accessible public spaces, green areas and parks to provide areas for communal gatherings, entertainment, 
													and more. These are just some of the principals they include when designing their brilliant cities.
                                                                                                           	When talking about Prometheva’s industry and economy, we can differentiate a few key sectors, as most of the planet's agriculture,
													construction and production are automated, most people work in the medical sector, engineering, education, etc. Additionally, the government
													finances ample research and development initiatives and artistic projects, employing a large portion of the population, and the rest usually
													work in small businesses that they have created. 
                                                                                                          	 The basis of this civilization’s socio-political ideology is a representative federal democracy in the political aspect, and a social 
													market economy in the economic one. This civilization maintains a very peaceful mentality, and prioritizes resource sustainability and 
													civilizational progress as a means to protect the future of itself. Some of the major social issues this civilization faces are low birth 
													rates, due to highly advanced technology incorporated into almost everything reducing the demand for more births, extremely high life expectancy,
													etc. They also struggle with over-automation, leading to a reduction in available jobs. This doesn’t have a severe effect on the unemployed people,
													because the government has multiple programs in place to help them, but it does lead to a sense of emptiness and uselessness in the lives of many.
													Nevertheless, most people on Prometheva enjoy their lives and are able to live in a safe and fulfilling manner.
														The planet will constantly receive UV radiation, which has a higher frequency (and thus, energy) and shorter wavelength than visible light,
													from its star. While UV rays can damage DNA and the proteins of organisms, causing diseases like cancer and other mutations, it can also promote the 
													production of vitamin D, essential for calcium processing (bone health) and immune system function. UV radiation can also split water molecules in 
													the upper atmosphere, producing oxygen atoms that can combine with other oxygen compounds to form ozone. An ozone layer in the atmosphere is essential
													for life, as it absorbs most of the harmful UV rays, minimizing the exposure of organisms. Knowing this, since the star is cooler than the sun, its
													maximum of emission shifts to the red, so it will radiate less in the UV spectrum. This might mean that organisms will develop less skin cancer and 
													diseases from UV light, but will still be able to produce sufficient vitamin D amounts.

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
												<p>
														 Life on Prometheva is very unique and wonderful, being constantly surrounded by glorious nature, impressive feats of engineering and beautifully
													designed cities, in combination with extremely affordable prices for goods, free services, and enticing job opportunities, this planet has it all,
													it does have some problems, but most civilizations do, and it doesn’t take away from this astonishing planet.
