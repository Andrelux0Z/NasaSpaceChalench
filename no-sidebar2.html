												<h2>Planetary Geology</h2>
												<p>Promethevaâ€™s geography, which contains a diverse array of features and characteristics, all interconnected by complex biogeochemical, tectonic, hydrological and atmospheric systems and cycles.</p>

												<h3>Planetary Structure</h3>
												<p>
													Core:
                                                                                                          The core is a very dense section with extremely high temperatures that is located at the middle 
													of Prometheva. It is made up of 85% molten iron and 15% molten nickel.

													Mantle: 
                                                                                                        Prometheva's mantle consists of 44.8% oxygen, 21, 5% silicon, 22, 8% magnesium, 5.8% iron, 
													2.2% aluminum, 2.3% calcium, 0.3% sodium, 0.03% potassium, and a few other minerals and elements. 
													<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>

													Crust:
                                                                                                        The planet's outermost layer is almost fully made up of 8 elements, with 98.5% of it being 
													oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium. The other 1.5% is
													formed by almost 100 other elements in very small amounts.

												<h3>Geography</h3>
												<p>
													Prometheva is made up of 5 main continents and a few scattered archipelagos, 2 medium bodies of saltwater, 6 large bodies of freshwater, 29 medium lakes, 18 expansive river networks, 2 polar ice caps, and 7 major mountain ranges. The whole planet is characterized by having an impressively widespread hydrosphere, allowing for the boundless growth of wildlife and the presence of an immense biodiversity. There are various different geographic zones and biomes, the most prominent ones being the coastal plain and the river valley (some of the most water dense and fertile areas on the planet). It will also have large swaths of jungles, forests, and swamps. There are a few inland plain and steppe regions.The planet will have canyon formations due to the water cycle and erosion; and certain delta regions and mangrove forests can be found along the coast. There are also a few deserts, which cover around 4% of the planet. As mentioned before, the planet will have many lakes dotted around the landscape. Additionally, the volcanic mountain ranges in Prometheva, rich in many useful minerals and metals, follow along the middle and sides of the continents, creating the aforementioned river valleys and coastal plains. Slightly below the surface we can also find an extensive aquifer network that gives even more access to freshwater.
The surface distribution of Prometheva is as follows: 4% of the planet is covered by desert, 6% is covered by mountain ranges and volcanoes, 3% is covered by plateaus, 5% is covered by inland plains and steppes, 2% is covered by mangrove forests and swamps, 10% is covered by plains and valleys, the other 70% is covered by bodies of water, with 13% being saltwater seas, 48% being large bodies of freshwater, 7% being rivers and natural canals,and 2% being small lakes.
